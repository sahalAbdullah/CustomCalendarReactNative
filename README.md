# CustomCalendarReactNative
I am excited to share that I have successfully created two custom calendars in React Native. One of these calendars serves as a date picker, providing a user-friendly interface for selecting specific dates. The other calendar is a complete calendar that resembles the ones commonly found on mobile devices. What makes these calendars truly unique is that I implemented them using TypeScript, allowing for seamless type checking and enhanced code readability. The custom design and implementation have provided me with a deep understanding of React Native and TypeScript, and I am proud of the level of customization achieved. These calendars will undoubtedly enhance the user experience and add significant value to any React Native project that requires intuitive date selection and navigation capabilities.
